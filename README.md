PaulCMS
=======

Warning PaulCMS is still in development so not everything is working yet and some functions are missing

#####About PaulCMS
PaulCMS is a Content Management System based on PHP, which means that you can manage your website that your website with PaulCMS. It's just like Wordpress and Joomla

#####Requirements
To run PaulCMS on your own website you have to have the following things:

PHP version 5.3 or greater
MySQL version 5.0 or greater
The mod_rewrite Apache module (if you are using a Apache server)
That’s really it. I recommend Apache or Nginx as the most robust and featureful server for running PaulCMS, but any server that supports PHP and MySQL will do it. That said, I can’t test every possible environment
